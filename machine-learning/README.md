# 归一化

The English translation of 归一化 is "normalization"
There are many different ways to normalize data, but some common methods include:
- Min-max normalization: This method scales the data so that the minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 1.
- Z-score normalization: This method subtracts the mean from each data point and then divides by the standard deviation.
- Decimal scaling: This method moves the decimal point of the data so that all values are integers.
The best normalization method to use depends on the specific data set and the machine learning task being performed.

Here are some examples of how normalization is used in practice:
- In image processing, normalization is used to improve the contrast of images.
- In natural language processing, normalization is used to remove stop words and stem words.
- In machine learning, normalization is used to prepare data for training and testing models.
